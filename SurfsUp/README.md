# # sqlalchemy-challenge
## # Climate analysis in Honolulu

In this two-part challenge I use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of  climate database for weather in Honolulu Hawaii using
- SQL ALchemy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

In the second part of this challenge I create a Flask API with the ability to query data sourced in part 1 using the API SQLite connection.
